Project pitch: 


Core goals: sciFi Films is a website devoted to fans of the sciFi & Fantasy film genre. Users can search by a movie name or year, and information for a particular movie image populates as a card on the screen. The movie information (title, year, synopsis, cast) should be displayed. 

Stretch project: Movie searches will bring up a trailer to be shown inside the theater next to the movie poster and information.
