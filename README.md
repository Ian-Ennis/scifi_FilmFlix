Project pitch: 


Core goals: sciFi Films is a website devoted to fans of the sciFi & Fantasy film genre. Users can search by a movie name or year, and information for a particular movie image populates as a card on the screen. The movie information (title, year, synopsis, cast) should be displayed. 

Stretch project: A matching-pairs card game. When the user clicks on a card, it should flip to reveal a movie poster, with detail information about the movie (title, year, synopsis, cast) populating the fields below the game. When the user clicks a second card and it matches the first, the cards will stay revealed (flipped over), and if they do not match, they will flip back over.
The game is complete when all matched pairs have been discovered.
